            Ready, fire, aim: the fast approach to software development. Ready,
            aim, aim, aim, aim: the slow approach to software development.
            (Anonymous) We will never become a truly paper-less society until
            the Palm Pilot folks come out with WipeMe 1.0. (Andy Pierson) The
            cheapest, fastest, and most reliable components are those that
            aren’t there. (Gordon Bell) The bulk of all patents are crap.
            Spending time reading them is stupid. It’s up to the patent owner to
            do so, and to enforce them. (Linus Torvalds)

            The trouble with programmers is that you can never tell what a
            programmer is doing until it’s too late. (Seymour Cray) Software
            undergoes beta testing shortly before it’s released. Beta is Latin
            for “still doesn’t work”. (Anonymous) The question of whether
            computers can think is like the question of whether submarines can
            swim. (Edsger W. Dijkstra) If debugging is the process of removing
            bugs, then programming must be the process of putting them in.
            (Edsger W. Dijkstra) It’s not a bug – it’s an undocumented feature.

            For a long time it puzzled me how something so expensive, so leading
            edge, could be so useless. And then it occurred to me that a
            computer is a stupid machine with the ability to do incredibly smart
            things, while computer programmers are smart people with the ability
            to do incredibly stupid things. They are, in short, a perfect match.
            (Bill Bryson) The Internet? Is that thing still around? (Homer
            Simpson) Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code
            will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live. (Martin
            Golding) Ready, fire, aim: the fast approach to software
            development. Ready, aim, aim, aim, aim: the slow approach to
            software development. (Anonymous) There are two ways of constructing
            a software design. One way is to make it so simple that there are
            obviously no deficiencies. And the other way is to make it so
            complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies. (C.A.R. Hoare)

            To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer.
            (Paul Ehrlich) There is no reason for any individual to have a
            computer in his home. (Ken Olson, President, Digital Equipment
            Corporation, 1977) I think there’s a world market for about 5
            computers. (Thomas J. Watson, Chairman of the Board, IBM, circa
            1948) 19 Jan 2038 at 3:14:07 AM (End of the word according to
            Unix–2^32 seconds after January 1, 1970)

            There are two ways to write error-free programs; only the third one
            works. (Alan J. Perlis) To iterate is human, to recurse divine. (L.
            Peter Deutsch) Measuring programming progress by lines of code is
            like measuring aircraft building progress by weight. (Bill Gates)
            There are two ways of constructing a software design. One way is to

            other way is to make it so complicated that there are no obvious
