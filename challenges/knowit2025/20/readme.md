Doesn't work (but gets close to the right answer idk what is wrong).

Very messy code of me trying to do a bounded knapsack where i also do binary decomposition to make it `O(n * log w)` instead of `O(n * w)`. Regardless it is increadibly slow due to complexities and there is some small logic error hidden there that makes me have a slightly wrong answer.
